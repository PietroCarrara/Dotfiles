# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repository

------------------

It uses the awesone ![dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop), go get it!

You can change the colors and wallpaper with ![pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) (super+shift+b to get a random one from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers).

There are also some dotdrop profiles that change the look besides colors: you can switch between them with super+shift+p.
